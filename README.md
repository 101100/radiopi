This project holds code to make a Raspberry Pi internet radio.

I put a Raspberry Pi, Wifi dongle, [simple amplifier](http://www.adafruit.com/products/987), and a [rotary encoder](http://www.adafruit.com/product/377) into an old bookshelf speaker.

The encoder adjusts volume and turns it on or off.  Each time you press the button it alternates between off and a random radio station.

It also says the name of the station and the city as it turns on.

There are only a few radio stations in the list, but more can be added in `streams.py`.
